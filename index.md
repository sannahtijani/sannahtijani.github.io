# ✋ Hi!

Hi, I’m Sannah — a first-year Economics PhD student at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna).

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, with a strong focus on political economics and the question of political bias in media content.

The second part of my research dives into crime economics, especially the sex work market. I’m exploring how gender inequalities shape this market and how legislation ties into human trafficking.

Finally, I bring it all together by looking at how stigma and bias influence policymaking — using sex work as a case in point.
