# ✋ Hi!

Hi, I’m Sannah — a first-year Economics PhD student at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna).

My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, with a strong focus on political and crime economics.

The first part of my research focus on the question of political bias in media content. The second part dives into the sex work market. I’m exploring how gender inequalities shape this market and how legislation ties into human trafficking. Finally, I bring it all together by looking at how stigma and bias influence policymaking — using sex work as a case in point.
